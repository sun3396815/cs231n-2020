# 
# The kNN classifier consists of two stages:
# 
# - During training, the classifier takes the training data and simply remembers it
# - During testing, kNN classifies every test image by comparing to all training images and transfering the labels of the k most similar training examples
# - The value of k is cross-validated
# 
# In this exercise you will implement these steps and understand the basic Image Classification pipeline, cross-validation, and gain proficiency in writing efficient, vectorized code.

# We would now like to classify the test data with the kNN classifier. Recall that we can break down this process into two steps: 
# 
# 1. First we must compute the distances between all test examples and all train examples. 
# 2. Given these distances, for each test example we find the k nearest examples and have them vote for the label
# 
# Lets begin with computing the distance matrix between all training and test examples. For example, if there are **Ntr** training examples and **Nte** test examples, this stage should result in a **Nte x Ntr** matrix where each element (i,j) is the distance between the i-th test and j-th train example.
# 
# **Note: For the three distance computations that we require you to implement in this notebook, you may not use the np.linalg.norm() function that numpy provides.**
# 
# First, open `cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py` and implement the function `compute_distances_two_loops` that uses a (very inefficient) double loop over all pairs of (test, train) examples and computes the distance matrix one element at a time.

# %%
# Open cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py and implement
# compute_distances_two_loops.
